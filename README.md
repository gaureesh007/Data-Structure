# 🚀 Array ADT Template Class in C++

A generic implementation of **Array Abstract Data Type (ADT)** in C++ using templates and dynamic memory allocation.  
This project demonstrates core data structure operations with scalable memory management.

The implementation works for **any data type** supported by C++ templates.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project provides a custom array structure supporting common array operations such as insertion, deletion, searching, rotation, and resizing.

Unlike static arrays, this implementation automatically increases capacity when needed.

The project is built primarily for **data structures learning and practical implementation**.

---

## ✨ Features

### Core Operations
- Append elements
- Insert at index
- Delete by index
- Delete by value
- Get element
- Set element

### Searching
- Linear Search
- Binary Search (auto-sorts array when required)

### Utility Operations
- Find maximum value
- Find minimum value
- Sum of elements (numeric types)

### Transform Operations
- Reverse array
- Left shift
- Right shift
- Left rotation
- Right rotation

### Memory Handling
- Dynamic resizing
- Copy constructor
- Assignment operator
- Proper memory cleanup

- Template programming
- Dynamic memory allocation
- Abstract Data Types
- Searching algorithms
- Memory management in C++
- Operator overloading
- Data structure design

⏱ Time Complexity Overview
Operation	Complexity
Append	O(1) amortized
Insert	O(n)
Delete	O(n)
Linear Search	O(n)
Binary Search	O(log n)
Reverse	O(n)
Shift/Rotate	O(n)
📚 Learning Outcome
